# Introduction
Quickster is a visual collaboration platform that gives teams perspective on projects. Quickster can be used to organize, collaborate, communicate and coordinate on projects and assignments. Quickster is great for a variety of work, educational, and personal uses, from school bulletin boards, lesson planning, collaborative student research projects and task management to planning and organizing your next vacation with your family.  The best part is quickster's collaboration-ability â€“ boards can be viewed, edited, and managed by multiple members so classrooms, teams, or families can keep track of everything and everyone in a really intuitive and visually appealing way!

# Working 
Quickster users create boards, lists, and cards.  Boards can be shared by an unlimited number of team members or collaborators.  Each board is a single web page which displays lists for that board laid out horizontally on the page. Cards are the items which make up a given list, and cards can be dragged and dropped onto other lists or reordered within lists. Each individual card can be comprised of a variety of things, including images, attachments/documents, deadlines, and notes.

# Application
While quickster may seem like a great tool to keep your own life organized, it has a ton of applicability in the classroom that might surprise you!  Quickster is a great tool for project-based learning.  Students can use quickster to take control of a project and outline the steps needed to bring it to completion.  They can split up tasks and plan what they need to meet goals.  They can move cards around as needed, or as pieces are completed, and you can track their progress in real time as they go!  You can even go in and set deadlines for individual components, which may help those procrastinators in your classroom. It is a great tool for synchronous or asynchronous communication, active learning, cooperative learning, and conducting research.
